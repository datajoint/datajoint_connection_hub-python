# DataJoint Hub Plugin

This is an official DataJoint Python plugin for connection to DataJoint Hub's hosted instances.

Note: This plugin adds features to the `datajoint` package and thus requires it. Users should not import directly from the plugin but instead simply `import datajoint` to access plugin features.
